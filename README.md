vertex
======
This is a very simple program that helps you to fit a parabola from three
points. This can be useful to determine the minima of a potential energy
surface.

To run the program you only have to call it as follows:

`python /path/to/vertex.py`

Then, you will be asked for the coordinates of your three points which you have
to enter in the format `valuex,valuey`.
